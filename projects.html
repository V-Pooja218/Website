            This project assists farmers and plant lovers in checking the health of plants using a smart digital system that measures temperature, humidity, light intensity, and soil moisture levels in real-time. The system shows the data from the sensors using a simple interface and sends notifications based on environmental factors. This allows users to take informed actions regarding watering, lighting, and plant care, resulting in healthy plant growth.
